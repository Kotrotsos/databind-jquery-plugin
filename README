   h2. Databind jQuery Plugin.

    Serializes a form into a JSON compatible JS object.
    $('yourform').fieldsToJSON()


    Databinds (one way for now) a JSON object onto the fields.
    $('yourform').JSONToFields()


See example.html source for how this works.

Small note, if name="root.val..." is not used, it searches for the initial data-bind value
and uses that for output. So you do not need to use name=".." if you already bind to the
data-bind attribute, however this can be convenient if  your output JSON structure looks
different than your input.
